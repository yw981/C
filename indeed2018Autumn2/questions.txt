A - ボ`ル / Balls
Time limit : 2sec / Memory limit : 1024MB

Score : 100 points

Problem Statement
You have one ball. You can cast the following two kinds of spells, A and B, any number of times in any order:

Spell A: When this spell is cast, the number of balls gets doubled instantaneously.
Spell B: When this spell is cast, the number of balls increases by 1 instantaneously.
Your objective is to have exactly N balls. Find the minimum total number of spells that you need to cast.

Note that you cannot reduce the number of balls by throwing them away.

Constraints
1≤N≤1018
Input
Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:

You can have 10 balls by casting four spells, as follows:

Cast Spell A. Now we have 2 balls.
Cast Spell A. Now we have 4 balls.
Cast Spell B. Now we have 5 balls.
Cast Spell A. Now we have 10 balls.

B - 旅行 / Journey
Time limit : 2sec / Memory limit : 1024MB

Score : 100 points

Problem Statement
There are N towns and M roads, each connecting two towns. The towns are numbered 1 through N, and the i-th road connects Town pi and Town qi (pi<qi). These roads are monodirectional, and for each road, you can only travel from the town with the smaller ID (Town pi) to the town with the larger ID (Town qi).

You are now at Town 1. You will go on a journey as follows:

If there is no road going out of the current town, finish the journey.
If there are some roads going out of the current town, choose one of those roads with equal probability and go along that road.
You will repeat this move until the journey is finished. Find the probability that you finish the journey at Town N.

Constraints
1≤N≤100 000
1≤M≤200 000
1≤pi<qi≤N
(pi,qi)≠(pj,qj) (i≠j)
Input

Output
Print the probability that you finish the journey at Town N. The output is considered correct if the absolute or relative error from the judge's output is at most 10?6.

There are two roads going out of Town 1. If the road leading to Town 5 is chosen, the journey will be finished at Town 5, but if the road leading to Town 2 is chosen, the journey will be finished at Town 2. Thus, the journey is finished at Town 5 with probability 1?2.

C - xの移 / Moving a Piece
Time limit : 2sec / Memory limit : 1024MB

Score : 100 points

Problem Statement
You have just placed a piece at point x=0 on a one-dimensional number line. You are also given T integers: a1,…,aT. You will repeat the operation described below indefinitely. In one operation, you move the piece T times, as follows:

Operation

Move the piece by a1 in the positive x-direction. (If a1 is negative, this is equivalent to moving the piece by ?a1 in the negative x-direction.)
Move the piece by a2 in the positive x-direction. (If a2 is negative, this is equivalent to moving the piece by ?a2 in the negative x-direction.)
:

Move the piece by aT in the positive x-direction. (If aT is negative, this is equivalent to moving the piece by ?aT in the negative x-direction.)
How many times will the piece be moved before the x-coordinate of the piece becomes S or greater for the first time? If the x-coordinate of the piece never becomes S or greater after any number of operations, print ?1 instead.

Constraints
1≤T≤105
1≤S≤109
?109≤ai≤109
ai≠0
All values in input are integers.
Input
Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:

a1 … aT
Output
Print the number of times that the piece will be moved before the x-coordinate of the piece becomes S or greater for the first time. If the x-coordinate of the piece never becomes S or greater after any number of operations, print ?1 instead.

In the third query, choosing the contiguous subsequence {?10} from {?5,?2,10,?10} results in the maximum absolute value of the sum, 10.
In the fourth query, choosing the contiguous subsequence {?5} from {?5} results in the maximum absolute value of the sum, 5.
