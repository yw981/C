A - Spiral Move
Time limit : 2sec / Memory limit : 256MB

Score : 100 points

Problem Statement
You are given a board with N rows and N columns of squares. Let the coordinates of the square at the i-th row and j-th column be (i,j) (1¡Üi,j¡ÜN). Initially, all the squares are white.

We will divide the passage of time into turns, and put a piece on square (1,1) at turn 1. The color of a square becomes black when visited by the piece. Square (1,1) turns black at turn 1.

Then, we will move the piece following the procedure below. Here, every time we move the piece by one square, one turn elapses.

Step 1: Repeatedly move the piece one square right as long as the destination is a white square.
Step 2: Repeatedly move the piece one square down as long as the destination is a white square.
Step 3: Repeatedly move the piece one square left as long as the destination is a white square.
Step 4: Repeatedly move the piece one square up as long as the destination is a white square.
Step 5: Go back to Step 1.
Find the coordinates of the square occupied by the piece at turn M.

B - Robot Orientation
Time limit : 2sec / Memory limit : 256MB

Score : 100 points

Problem Statement
There are N robots on the xy-plane. The current coordinates of the i-th robot at the 0-th minute is (ai,bi) (1¡Üi¡ÜN).

At every minute from now on until the T-th minute, the robots must be at the N checkpoints specified for each minute. Each of the N checkpoints specified for the same minute must be occupied by one robot. The coordinates of the j-th of the checkpoints specified for the i-th minute is (cij,dij) (1¡Üi¡ÜT,1¡Üj¡ÜN).

The Manhattan distance between two points (x1,y1) and (x2,y2) is |x1?x2|+|y1?y2|. Here, |x| represents the absolute value of x.

Find the minimum total distance covered by the optimal movement of the robots until the T-th minute. Here, use Manhattan distance to calculate the distances covered by the robots.

C - Network Configuration
Time limit : 2sec / Memory limit : 256MB

Score : 100 points

Problem Statement
There are N servers on the network in your office. Each server can only communicate with the other N?1 servers.

You are given M forbidden pairs (ai,bi)(1¡Üi¡ÜM) of servers. Each of them means that direct communication between server ai and bi is forbidden.

You will configure the network under these constraints. More specifically, for every pair of two different servers, you will determine whether they will directly communicate each other. Two configurations of network is considered different if there exist two servers that directly communicate in one of the two configuration, and do not directly communicate in the other.

Under these conditions, you need to configure the network so that every servers can communicate with all other servers. How many different such configurations there are?

D - Defeat the Monsters!
Time limit : 2sec / Memory limit : 256MB

Score : 100 points

Problem Statement
A magician is fighting N monsters. The health of the i-th monster is Hi(1¡Üi¡ÜN). When a monster receives an attack of power atk, its health decreases by atk. A monster is considered defeated when its health becomes zero or below.

There is a parameter for the magician, called the level. Before the fight, the value of the level is set to a positive integer K. The magician can perform two kinds of attacks. One attack of each kind targets one monster. These attacks are:

Normal attack: has a power of 1 and can be used any number of times.
Magic attack: has a power of K (that is, equal to the level) and can be used at most A times.
Also, there is an additional constraint: he can perform at most B attacks in total, due to his limited stamina.

Determine whether the magician can defeat all the monsters. If it is possible, find the minimum level necessary to defeat them.
